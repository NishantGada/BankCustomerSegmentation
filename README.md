# BankCustomerSegmentation

In this project we have a bank's data set of it's customers for the past six months. The Data includes transaction frequency, amount, tenure, etc.

We have to divide the dataset into 4 groups wherein each group represents a set of customers that has similar features / properties. 

This analysis will help in customer segmentation or 'market segmentation' with the help of which the Bank can launch targeted marketing campaigns which are unique and specific to every customer group.
