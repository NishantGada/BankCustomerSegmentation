# BankCustomerSegmentation

Note: It will be better to run this code in a python notebook instead of an editor such a PyCharm as it will ease the tasks and help in differentiating between them. 
As the code progresses and the number of plots increase, the difficulty of viewing each plot in an editor / IDE increases, so preferable use a Python Notebook such as Jupyter. 

In this project we have a bank's data set of it's customers for the past six months. The Data includes transaction frequency, amount, tenure, etc.

We have to divide the dataset into 4 groups wherein each group represents a set of customers that has similar features / properties. 

This analysis will help in customer segmentation or 'market segmentation' with the help of which the Bank can launch targeted marketing campaigns which are unique and specific to every customer group.   

The customer data has been provided in the for of a CSV file.
